        "- Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).\n",

        "In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs.\n",
